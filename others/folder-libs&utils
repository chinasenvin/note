the difference between folder libs and utils

libs/ is where libs (like actual well done libraries) live  --senvin: get from online
utils/ is where utility bits and pieces live                --senvin: create by myself

basically libs is a more polished thing. lib is where i'd have a local copy of some package or i've cloned a library from the internet. and utils is a more of a freeform bucket where various cross-concern bits and pieces go, they don't have to be actual libs.

although i'm kind of agree that we have the model and controller stuff in there that are technically more libs than utils, but i was hoping to move those into a shared npm package at some point and leave utils for the app specific nuts and bolts.
