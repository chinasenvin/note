Naming rules

block-name__elem-name_mod-name_mod-val
Names are written in lowercase Latin letters.
Words are separated by a hyphen (-).

The block name defines the namespace for its elements and modifiers.
The element name is separated from the block name by a double underscore (__).
The modifier name is separated from the block or element name by a single underscore (_).
The modifier value is separated from the modifier name by a single underscore (_).
For boolean modifiers, the value is not included in the name.
Important: Elements of elements do not exist in the BEM methodology. The naming rules do not allow creating elements of elements, but you can nest elements inside each other in the DOM tree.
